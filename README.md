# Pest-detection-system
A system to detect pests using YOLOv8 AI and a companion app to help prevent and mitigate the pest attack

## How to run the AI models in your PC:

Install YOLOv8
```
pip install ultralytics 
```

Clone this repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/devalopr/Pest-detection-system
```

### We trained 3 AI models using YOLOv8 to detect pests. 

Run ```BPH Burn detect.py``` to run the AI model that runs on a drone to detect BPH pest attack

Run ```BPH Pest detect.py``` to run the AI model that detects BPH pest

Run ```WHEAT Pest detect.py``` to run the AI model that detects Wheat midget pest
